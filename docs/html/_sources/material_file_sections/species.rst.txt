Species Properties
######################

The section of material properties defines the models and parameters governing diffusive mass
transport, whether it be ordinary, forced or thermal diffusion of species. Included in those
generalizations are electrical potential-driven species movements. Models include those for single
species, especially particle-laden suspensions, binary species and multi-component systems.
Models for various equations of mass transport are included, various models of diffusion
properties, different representations of species by means of molar, mass or volume concentrations,
various models of vapor pressure for multiphase flow and on material boundaries for lumped
parameter analyses, and properties for charged species.
