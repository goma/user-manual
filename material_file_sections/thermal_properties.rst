Thermal Properties
######################

In this section of material properties, the user specifies the parameters of models for Fourier heat
conduction and thermally-induced density changes (by volume expansion) and parameters
controlling the onset of phase changes. Properties governing energy transport by convection,
radiation and diffusion are specified elsewhere.
