**Description / Usage**

This card indicates the method to be used to renormalize the phase function fields
during the course of the computation.

========================  ===================================================================
<char_string>             A character string which specifies the type of method for
                          renormalization. Choices for this string are: **Huygens,
                          Huygens_Constrained.**
**Huygens**               In this renormalization method a set **P** of *m* discrete points
                          is constructed that lie on the zero contour of the j\ :sup:`th` 
                          phase function field: 

                          *EQUATION*
			                    The finite element interpolating functions make this an easy task
			                    for *Goma*. For each mesh node, *k*, a minimum distance to this
                          set of points is determined, D\ :sub:`k` and the value of phase
                          function at that node is replaced by D\ :sub:`k` multiplied 
                          by the original phase function sign at that node. This method is
                          fast and robust and, given sufficiently refined meshes and
                          high order (Q2) interpolation of the phase function fields,
                          reasonably accurate. Howeverr, for lower order
                          interpolation this method is prone to lose mass over time.
**Huygens_Constrained**   This method of renormalization functions in much the same
                          way as the previous method, except it employs Lagrange multiplier 
                          to enforce a global constraint that requires that
                          the volume of “negative” phase function remain unchanged
                          before and after the renormalization. This requirement
                          makes the method significantly better at conserving mass.
                          However, it also does introduce an extraphysical movement
                          of material within the domain.

**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

Renormalization is an operation particular to phase function (and level set) embedded
interface tracking. The phase function fields are defined originally as distanes from a
known curve or surface. This type of function offers benefits in terms of smoothness of
representation and the easy with which interfacial physics can be included. However,
typically we are evolving these functions using the commonplace advection operator:

 .. figure:: /figures/011_goma_physics.png
			:align: center
			:width: 70%

which does not necessarily perpetuate the phase field as a distance function. Sharp
gradients or flat regions in the function may therefore appear near the interface which
have various detrimental effects on the accuracy of the solution. The solution that is
most often used is to periodically construct the interfaces from the phase function field
and renormalize the phase function fields, i.e. reevaluated them so that they return to
being distance functions from the interface. In general, this is a satisfactory solution if
the frequency of renormalization is not too great. To set the criteria for determining
when to renormalize the phase functions see the *Phase Function Renormalization
Tolerance* card.
