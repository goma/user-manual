**Description / Usage**
-----------------------

**(PCC/VARIED)**

This boundary condition card is actually a multiplicative building block that can be
used to impose a multiplicative time modulation of a specified functional form on any
set of *GD_** conditions. *NOTE: unlike the other* *GD_** *cards which are additive*, 
*this card is multiplicative*. This condition must be placed after any single or set of *GD_**
cards for which the user wishes to modulate (viz. *GD_LINEAR, GD_PARAB*, etc.). The
card can be used as many times as needed to construct the desired function. The
examples below will clarify its use. Definitions of the input parameters are as follows:

=================== =================================================================
**GD_TIME**         Name of the boundary condition (<bc_name>).
**SS**              Type of boundary condition (<bc_type>), where **SS**
                    denotes side set in the EXODUS II database.
<bc_id>             The boundary flag identifier, an integer associated with
                    <bc_type> that identifies the boundary location (side set
                    in EXODUS II) in the problem domain.
<equation_name>     A character string indicating the equation to which this
                    boundary condition is applied (see the list of permissible
                    values in the discussion above for *Category 1*).
<integer1>          Species number of the mass transport equation. The
                    value should be 0 unless the <equation_name> is of type R_MASS.
<time_func_name>    Keyword to identify the functional form of the time
                    modulation. Permissible values for this parameter are
                    LINEAR, EXPONENTIAL, and SINUSOIDAL.
<integer2>          Set this required but unused parameter to zero.
<float1>            C\ :sub:`0` model parameter
<float2>            C\ :sub:`1` model parameter

The functional form of each time-modulation model is as follows:

**Examples**
------------

Following is a sample card set:
::

	BC = GD_LINEAR SS 1 R_MESH_NORMAL 0 MESH_DISPLACEMENT1 0 1. 0.

::

	BC = GD_TIME SS 1 R_MESH_NORMAL 0 SINUSOIDAL 0 10. 2.

::

	BC = GD_LINEAR SS 1 R_MESH_NORMAL 0 MESH_POSITION1 0 0. -1.

This set of cards leads to the application of x = sin(10.0 + 2t) to the normal component
of the mesh displacement at side set 1. If side set 1 were a surface of constant x (viz.
normal in the x-direction) then this condition could be used to impose a piston motion
to the surface. Recall that *GD_LINEAR* cards are additive with each other and
*GD_TIME* is multiplicative with the previous cards. The first card is used to put a
constant of 1.0 in the equation, the second card (*GD_TIME* card) multiplies that
constant with the sinusoidal time function, and the third card is used to put the linear
term on mesh position. Note carefully the signs used.

**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

This boundary condition building block is very useful for imposing time-dependent
boundary conditions with some fairly standard functional forms without the
inconvenience of writing a user-defined boundary condition. Boundary conditions for
pulsating flow, piston motion, roll-eccentricity effects in coating, time-evolving
temperature transients, etc. can all be constructed using this card. The examples at the
end of this section on *GD_** options will help the user construct such functions.
