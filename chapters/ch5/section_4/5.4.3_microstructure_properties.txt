**Microstructure Properties**
*****************************

Microstructure property models address material parameters and constitutive equations required
for multiphase continuum approaches to flow in porous media, viz. fluid flow in partially or fully
saturated porous media. Actually, only a few of these model/property cards pertain directly to
media structure or microstructure, but all are affected by intrinsic material properties of all
involved phases. Cards or records typically appearing in this section fall into one of three
categories: microstructural or flow-property specification, numerical treatment specification, and
species transport property specifications. These “sections” appear in this order in most of the
sample input files.
